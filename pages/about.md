<p>Release notes</p>
<ol>
  <li>Major RFCs approved (check the opendsu.com site). The DSU APIs proven stable in OpenDSU SDK will be preserved in all future versions.</li>
<li>Release 2.0.0 declares the "legacy" DSU APIs stable. However, we changed the caching mechanism of the DSU (removed any long-term caching). We introduced "startOrAttachBatch" as the best method for working in batch mode.</li>
<li>Release 2.0.1 is declared the first production-ready release. (It does not have changes on public APIs but has many stability and security-related fixes).</li>
</ol>
