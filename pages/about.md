</ol>

<p>Release notes</p>
<ol>
  <li>Major RFCs approved (check the opendsu.com site). The DSU APIs proven stable in OpenDSU SDK will be preserved in all future versions.</li>
<li>Release 2.0.0 declares the "legacy" DSU APIs stable. However, we changed the caching mechanism of the DSU (removed any long-term caching). We introduced "startOrAttachBatch" as the best method for working in batch mode.</li>
<li>Release 2.0.1 is declared the first production-ready release. (It does not have changes on public APIs but has many stability and security-related fixes).</li>
</ol>
  OpenDSU open source code and documentation were obtained from the PrivateSky research project (2015-2021) coordinated by Alexandru Ioan Cuza University from Iasi in collaborations with the following companies: Axiologic Research (original code contributor), Heaven Solutions, Romsoft, Code932, DPO, Space Giant, Junio, AquaSoft. The initial code of PrivateSky used open source code (MIT licensed) from Axiologic Research belonging to the SwarmESB Research project about executable choreographies (2010-2015) All the code and documentation of OpenDSU and PrivateSky are licensed using the MIT Open Source license. After 2020, the PharmaLedger project building an innovative blockchain platform for the Pharma Industry started contributing to the OpenDSU code and is using OpenDSU as their main architectural approach.
