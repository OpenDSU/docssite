**OpenDSU Major Release**

<ol>
<li>0.x.x releases under PrivateSky research project leadership (2019-2020)</li>
<li>1.x.x releases under Axiologic Research leadership (2020 - march 2023): RFC proposed the major APIs in OpenDSK</li>
<li>2.x.x releases under Axiologic Research leadership (2023 - 202x):</li>
</ol>

<p>Release notes</p>
<ol>
 <li>Major RFCs approved (check the opendsu.com site). The DSU APIs proven stable in OpenDSU SDK will be preserved in all future versions.</li>
 <li>Release 2.0.0 declares the "legacy" DSU APIs stable. However, we changed the caching mechanism of the DSU (removed any long-term caching). We introduced "startOrAttachBatch" as the best method for working in batch mode.</li>
 <li>Release 2.0.1 is declared the first production-ready release. (It does not have changes on public APIs but has many stability and security-related fixes).</li>
</ol>
