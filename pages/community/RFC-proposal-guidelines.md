# Abstract

The purpose of this RFC is to provide a Google Docs template that will be used to propose new RFCs.  

<p style='text-align: justify;'>As a reminder, "a RFC is authored by individuals or groups of engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts or information"[1].
</p>

To submit a new proposal, create a copy of this template (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gePhhEygme3oo74i-bzWKQgA_yjMAMGskw4U6g--XVY/edit#heading=h.leaepr4b4whq">here</a>), modify it and send a sharing link to <a href="">opendsu@axiologic.net</a>

| Rejected           | The RFC has been rejected                                   |
| Accepted           | The proposal has been accepted and will be implemented      |
| Enacted            | RFC has been processed and is part of the official codebase |
