Abstract

The purpose of this RFC is to provide a Google Docs template that will be used to propose new RFCs.  

As a reminder, ‘’a RFC is authored by individuals or groups of engineers and computer scientists in the form of a memorandum describing methods, behaviors, research, or innovations applicable to the working of the Internet and Internet-connected systems. It is submitted either for peer review or to convey new concepts or information’’[1].

To submit a new proposal, create a copy of this template (here), modify it and send a sharing link to opendsu@axiologic.net
